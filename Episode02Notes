#Bundler
Our whole code needs to be compressed , cleaned before we put it to production.
Webpack, parsel are some of the bundlers. 

We are going to use parcel for bundler in our example. All bundlers are same , the internal implementations vary.

Parcel comes as a package , can be taken from npm.

npm install -D parcel --> why -D ?? Telling the parcel is a dev dependency , not required for production
2 types of depencies and app can have. 1. Dev dependencies , 2. Project dependencies

npx parcel index.html --> executing the parcel bundler. 

npm --> downloads dependencies , npx --> execute command

# Another way to bring react into our application : npm
We can do it via CDN links , but it is not preferred . It will make another network call to get React. 

npm install react 
npm install react-dom
